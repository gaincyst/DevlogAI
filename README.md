## 🎯 What Is DEVLOG AI?

DEVLOG AI is a personal web app that transforms your daily coding notes, bugs, breakthroughs, and brainstorms into an organized, searchable journal—augmented by AI. Think of it as a smarter dev diary that helps you reflect, tag, summarize, and even draft polished blog posts from your own logs.
